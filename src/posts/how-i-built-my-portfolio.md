# How I Built My Portfolio

This post covers the process, design decisions, and tech stack behind my personal website. I used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX for a fast, modern, and minimalist experience.

## Key Features
- Modular project data
- Custom accent color palette
- Responsive, accessible design
